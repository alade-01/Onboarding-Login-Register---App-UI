# Welcome, Sign In, Sign up and Forgot Password - Flutter UI

We design four responsive screensÂ with takeover input on each screen: first is welcome screen, 
user opens your app, it shows, then users have two options if user has an account, then press the 
login button and it moves, just take the user to the login screen, or if they don't have one, press 
the register button to go to the login screen registration and finally if the user forgets their password 
then press the forgotten password button. All these screens work perfectly on Android, iOS
